AllAboutErik - migration to Nuxt3 issues
----------------------------------------

- VBTooltip directive not available from BootstrapVue yet (used on BackgroundMusic.vue)
- BCarousel doesn't seem to be working correctly (used on SlideshowImages which is used on Roots)
- May need to replace ks-vue-fullpage, hasn't been updated in 5 years and may not be compatible with Vue 3. Alternative is fullpage.js (https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) (Vue wrapper: https://github.com/alvarotrigo/vue-fullpage.js) - cost is $36 for one time hobby licence.



Bootstrap-Vue components etc.
------------------------------
Flex:
b-container
b-row
b-col

b-button
b-tooltip

b-carousel
b-carousel-slide



Migrate from Bootstrap-Vue to Vuetify or Quasar for proper Vue 3 support
