mainTextTop: "In the 20's and 30's, as the Japanese were planning on pursuing their dreams of empire, they projected themselves to other Asian nations as saviors that would rid Asia of white racist domination under their enlightened modern leadership. During this time, there developed a burgeoning and largely unregulated market for textiles that reflected their growing military might and ambitions. As they mobilized for war, these ideas sank deeply into civil society and was both promoted by and reflected in these propaganda textiles."
