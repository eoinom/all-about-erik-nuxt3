mainTextTop: This in-depth, full-color work is a comprehensive survey exploring
  the theme of the skeleton in Japanese kimono art. For centuries, images of
  skulls, bones, and skeletons played roles in the religious and popular
  artistic history of Japan in the form of paintings, scrolls, woodblock prints,
  books, lacquerware, and even personal accessories. Although images of skulls
  and bones carried great significance in Buddhism throughout the centuries, and
  skeletons became a faddish artistic interest in the late Meiji period, prior
  to the twentieth century few such images were to be seen on clothing.
mainTextBottom: The two decades in which skeleton imagery gained greatest
  popular attention as decorative motifs for traditional Japanese garments
  encompassed the Taishō (1912-1926) and early Shōwa eras (1926-1989), a period
  lasting roughly from about 1920 to the mid to late 1930s, losing its emphasis
  as Japan moved closer to total war. This period corresponds to what Miriam
  Silverberg terms Japan’s “modan [modern] years,” a time characterized by a
  post-traditional, cosmopolitan world no longer bound by timeless customs and
  informed by a sense of open-ended possibilities, new mores, and the mass
  communications that were shaping the material and popular culture of the
  nation. The general national atmosphere was ideal for creative expansion on
  many levels, and not least in the arena of textile design, where a new genre
  was also making itself felt among the buying public. The book is 132 pages and
  contains 47 full color plates with additional detail photographs and
  descriptions.
