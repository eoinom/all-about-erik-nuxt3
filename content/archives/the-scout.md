I really loved scouting. We camped out, built fires, cooked outside, went snipe hunting, sang songs, and slept in tents. We hiked, we had knives and whittled. I carved a neckerchief slide that looked like a lobster. We learned to swear and how to piss and shit in the woods. We earned merit badges, learning lots in many different areas of skill and knowledge. You needed 21 merit badges to become an eagle scout, the highest rank. I achieved the feat by the time I was 13.
