My younger son Nico is the result of my love affair with his mom Kim Wilkins. He was born in 1987. He’s a talented and creative guy. He lives in Brooklyn. He produces and DJ’s a kind of music he calls “Techno Trance”. He’s also been working for a clothing company as a “Cultural Concierge”, scouting locations, doing interviews, and writing critiques on art, food and music. He’s an expert on *uni* and expensive bottles of organic wine. He’s always traveling around in one capacity or another.
