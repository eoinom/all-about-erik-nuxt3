My older son, who I call JD, lives in Nelson, British Colombia. I had a relationship with a sweet Canadian gal named Karen Dulisse, and in 1971 she gave birth to Jakob. He’s got dual citizenship, US and Canadian. He works as an independent contractor, doing environmental impact studies, and he’s an all-round wildlife biologist and photographer. He’s married to Anna Lamb Yorski, and they have a cute little daughter named Bianca, AKA Bee. In many ways JD’s a chip off the old block, nature boy, fisherman, and traveler.
