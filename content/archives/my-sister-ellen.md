My little sister is ten years younger than I am. My parents always referred to her as the best mistake they ever made. She was a cute little gal. Because of the age difference between us, I was more or less out of the house when she was still pretty young. She followed my “career” faithfully and has always been a sweet and positive sis. We saw each other intermittently over the years, and it wasn’t until we were both were quite a bit older that we bonded as adult people. She’s a dermatologist and the mother of two boys, one an MD, and the other an academic. We get along well and we’re close now.
