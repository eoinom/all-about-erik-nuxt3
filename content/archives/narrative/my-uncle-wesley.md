        When he first came to the states in 1927, he was 18 years old. He was super handy with tools, and he borrowed some money from my dad, bought 3 wrecked Fords, and combined the parts that were intact into a complete car, which he sold for a good profit.

        Around this time, Wesley was dating a Greek girl back in Chicago. One evening, when he came to pick her up for a date, he was confronted by her drunken father who was sitting on the front porch, with booze in one hand, and a pistol in the other. Intent upon dissuading Wesley from seeing his daughter, he ordered him to leave immediately, and began counting to ten. Wesley thought it was a joke at first, but by the count of four, he became convinced otherwise, and turned and ran for his life. At the count of six, the old son of a bitch shot my uncle in the leg as he fled.

        He loved going to closeout auctions and bought all kinds of stuff. When I was eight, he gave me a full-on bandsaw for my birthday, and a professional lathe for my ninth. My dad told him that he was crazy to give those dangerous tools to a kid, but I never lost a finger, and watching him work I ended up being pretty familiar with almost every type of tool. He bought a series of boats.

        Later, he took the boat down the Mississippi and across the Gulf of Mexico to Florida. My brother, my cousin, and I flew down to Fort Myers to join him. When we arrived, he was lying on the bottom of the boat under one of the engines, covered in grease and oil and surrounded by parts and tools. When the repairs were completed, we headed up the waterway towards Lake Okeechobee. As we motored out on the Lake, we went aground, and Wesley made us jump into the murky water to help push the boat free. Our bare feet sank deeply into the muddy ooze. We kept a nervous eye out for alligators, but finally got the boat free. Halfway across the lake, a terrible storm came up. The lake was only 13 feet deep and the waves were 13 feet high. We hit the bottom repeatedly, losing one propeller and bending the other. We bailed frantically as waves crashed onto the deck. Everything was floating around. But as suddenly as it had started, the wind died down and the sun reappeared.

        He was a thrifty guy, and one night around midnight he and I headed up to Wisconsin, driving for hours along a narrow two -lane road that paralleled the highway, just to save a few bucks in tolls. We got there a little after 4:00 AM. He headed straight to the bathroom, where the toilet had been removed. He picked up a 50-pound pipe wrench, the biggest I'd ever seen, got on the floor, and set the jaws of the wrench around a huge flat 6-inch nut that held the outlet pipe in place. Lying on his back, his arms and shoulders braced against the wall, and his feet on the handle of the wrench, he pushed with all the strength his legs could muster, finally breaking the nut free.  When Wesley had something to do, he did it. The next day we went to his favorite market up in Delavan, where they sold damaged goods at half price.

        Wesley did have a temper and could act gruff and tough, but inside he had a heart of gold. In his big apartment building he often gave free rent to the occasional wino or hooker down on their luck. He had a nice apartment he kept for stray cats. He loved kids.

When Wesley had something to do, he did it. The next day we went to his favorite market up in Delavan, where they sold damaged goods at half price.

        Wesley did have a temper and could act gruff and tough, but inside he had a heart of gold. In his big apartment building he often gave free rent to the occasional wino or hooker down on their luck. He had a nice apartment he kept for stray cats. He loved kids.

        Around this time, Wesley was dating a Greek girl back in Chicago. One evening, when he came to pick her up for a date, he was confronted by her drunken father who was sitting on the front porch, with booze in one hand, and a pistol in the other. Intent upon dissuading Wesley from seeing his daughter, he ordered him to leave immediately, and began counting to ten. Wesley thought it was a joke at first, but by the count of four, he became convinced otherwise, and turned and ran for his life. At the count of six, the old son of a bitch shot my uncle in the leg as he fled.

        He loved going to closeout auctions and bought all kinds of stuff. When I was eight, he gave me a full-on bandsaw for my birthday, and a professional lathe for my ninth. My dad told him that he was crazy to give those dangerous tools to a kid, but I never lost a finger, and watching him work I ended up being pretty familiar with almost every type of tool. He bought a series of boats.

        Later, he took the boat down the Mississippi and across the Gulf of Mexico to Florida. My brother, my cousin, and I flew down to Fort Myers to join him. When we arrived, he was lying on the bottom of the boat under one of the engines, covered in grease and oil and surrounded by parts and tools. When the repairs were completed, we headed up the waterway towards Lake Okeechobee. As we motored out on the Lake, we went aground, and Wesley made us jump into the murky water to help push the boat free. Our bare feet sank deeply into the muddy ooze. We kept a nervous eye out for alligators, but finally got the boat free. Halfway across the lake, a terrible storm came up. The lake was only 13 feet deep and the waves were 13 feet high. We hit the bottom repeatedly, losing one propeller and bending the other. We bailed frantically as waves crashed onto the deck. Everything was floating around. But as suddenly as it had started, the wind died down and the sun reappeared.

        The boat limped out into the Atlantic near Stuart, the “Sailfish Capital of the World”. Wesley had bought an old rod and clunky reel strung with antique braided line, as well as some old-fashioned lures. I trolled one behind the boat. A large dark shadow rose from the depths following behind the lure. To our astonishment it was a sailfish, which ate the lure, and after a struggle, we landed this beauty.

        He was a thrifty guy, and one night around midnight he and I headed up to Wisconsin, driving for hours along a narrow two -lane road that paralleled the highway, just to save a few bucks in tolls. We got there a little after 4:00 AM. He headed straight to the bathroom, where the toilet had been removed. He picked up a 50-pound pipe wrench, the biggest I'd ever seen, got on the floor, and set the jaws of the wrench around a huge flat 6-inch nut that held the outlet pipe in place. Lying on his back, his arms and shoulders braced against the wall, and his feet on the handle of the wrench, he pushed with all the strength his legs could muster, finally breaking the nut free.

We kept a nervous eye out for alligators, but finally got the boat free. Halfway across the lake, a terrible storm came up. The lake was only 13 feet deep and the waves were 13 feet high. We hit the bottom repeatedly, losing one propeller and bending the other. We bailed frantically as waves crashed onto the deck. Everything was floating around. But as suddenly as it had started, the wind died down and the sun reappeared.

        The boat limped out into the Atlantic near Stuart, the “Sailfish Capital of the World”. Wesley had bought an old rod and clunky reel strung with antique braided line, as well as some old-fashioned lures. I trolled one behind the boat. A large dark shadow rose from the depths following behind the lure. To our astonishment it was a sailfish, which ate the lure, and after a struggle, we landed this beauty.

        He was a thrifty guy, and one night around midnight he and I headed up to Wisconsin, driving for hours along a narrow two -lane road that paralleled the highway, just to save a few bucks in tolls. We got there a little after 4:00 AM. He headed straight to the bathroom, where the toilet had been removed. He picked up a 50-pound pipe wrench, the biggest I'd ever seen, got on the floor, and set the jaws of the wrench around a huge flat 6-inch nut that held the outlet pipe in place.

        Lying on his back, his arms and shoulders braced against the wall, and his feet on the handle of the wrench, he pushed with all the strength his legs could muster, finally breaking the nut free.  When Wesley had something to do, he did it. The next day we went to his favorite market up in Delavan, where they sold damaged goods at half price.

        Wesley did have a temper and could act gruff and tough, but inside he had a heart of gold. In his big apartment building he often gave free rent to the occasional wino or hooker down on their luck. He had a nice apartment he kept for stray cats. He loved kids.

        When he first came to the states in 1927, he was 18 years old. He was super handy with tools, and he borrowed some money from my dad, bought 3 wrecked Fords, and combined the parts that were intact into a complete car, which he sold for a good profit.

        He worked at several jobs in the late 30’s, but he also got into real estate, buying old multistory homes in Chicago and converting each floor into separate apartments. Whether carpentry, electricity, or plumbing; he could do it all.

        Around this time, Wesley was dating a Greek girl back in Chicago. One evening, when he came to pick her up for a date, he was confronted by her drunken father who was sitting on the front porch, with booze in one hand, and a pistol in the other.

        Intent upon dissuading Wesley from seeing his daughter, he ordered him to leave immediately, and began counting to ten. Wesley thought it was a joke at first, but by the count of four, he became convinced otherwise, and turned and ran for his life. At the count of six, the old son of a bitch shot my uncle in the leg as he fled.

        He loved going to closeout auctions and bought all kinds of stuff. When I was eight, he gave me a full-on bandsaw for my birthday, and a professional lathe for my ninth. My dad told him that he was crazy to give those dangerous tools to a kid, but I never lost a finger, and watching him work I ended up being pretty familiar with almost every type of tool. He bought a series of boats.

        Later, he took the boat down the Mississippi and across the Gulf of Mexico to Florida. My brother, my cousin, and I flew down to Fort Myers to join him. When we arrived, he was lying on the bottom of the boat under one of the engines, covered in grease and oil and surrounded by parts and tools. When the repairs were completed, we headed up the waterway towards Lake Okeechobee. As we motored out on the Lake, we went aground, and Wesley made us jump into the murky water to help push the boat free. Our bare feet sank deeply into the muddy ooze. We kept a nervous eye out for alligators, but finally got the boat free. Halfway across the lake, a terrible storm came up. The lake was only 13 feet deep and the waves were 13 feet high. We hit the bottom repeatedly, losing one propeller and bending the other. We bailed frantically as waves crashed onto the deck. Everything was floating around. But as suddenly as it had started, the wind died down and the sun reappeared.

        The boat limped out into the Atlantic near Stuart, the “Sailfish Capital of the World”. Wesley had bought an old rod and clunky reel strung with antique braided line, as well as some old-fashioned lures. I trolled one behind the boat. A large dark shadow rose from the depths following behind the lure. To our astonishment it was a sailfish, which ate the lure, and after a struggle, we landed this beauty.
