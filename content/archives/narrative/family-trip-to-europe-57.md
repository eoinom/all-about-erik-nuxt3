        My dad had a dream of taking the family back to Norway and doing a familial tour of Europe. In those days the whole family could take their passport picture together.

        I agreed to go somewhat reluctantly. I was a freshman in college. Bearing in mind the age difference between a 19-year-old and a 9-year-old sister, with a brother in between, we were a somewhat disparate group. But we all departed from New York City aboard the Kungsholm together and headed out across the Atlantic toward Europe.  

        We had the perfunctory lifeboat drill and put on our flotation devices.

        A high point of the cruise was my little sister winning two consecutive bingo games. The passengers thought it was so cute when she won the first game, but not so much the second.  She won one hundred and fifty dollars. There was widespread grumbling on the part of the competition. Cute only goes so far. My parents had been in touch with a Citroen dealer in France and arranged to have the car delivered to us on the dock in Goteborg, Sweden, when we disembarked. But when we arrived, there was no one to meet us and no car. One by one everyone left, and they closed the place up, leaving us alone on the dock with our luggage. After much frantic phoning we finally learned the French driver had been in an accident en-route, damaging our car and necessitating some quick repairs.  

        We stayed overnight in Goteborg.

        We got news our car had finally arrived in Goteborg, and my dad went back to Sweden to pick up our Citroen. In addition to the front bumper being taped on because of the collision in France, the car had been rear-ended on the road with my dad behind the wheel on the way to Oslo. Into the repair shop it went.  

        Here’s a picture of the car after the repairs had been made.

        We stopped overnight, and the next morning my dad, my brother, and I decided to hike down to the river with borrowed equipment and try our luck fishing. It was a tough slog and halfway down my dad who was older, a little overweight, and out of shape, tripped stepping over a big log and fell heavily to the ground. An audible cracking sound emanated from his foot. As he lay there in agony, his eyes glazed over, and he uttered what became an evergreen of familial hilarity in later years. He said ‘’have fun-go fishing “. To get him back up the trail, it took four strong Norwegians with some minor assistance on my part. Needless to say, the incident was to cast a dark pall over the exciting family vacation that was barely underway. They gave us directions to the nearest medical clinic some distance up the mountain road.

        My dad was taken inside and emerged sometime later with crutches and a large cast on his foot. We continued on our way, my mom at the wheel, and my dad moaning softly in the front seat. The road narrowed and then water appeared far below on one side. Huge jagged boulders had been placed on the edge of the road to keep travelers from falling over the precipice to their certain deaths. My dad's pain was intensifying. Apparently, the cast had been applied prematurely and his broken foot was continuing to swell in the confines of the cast. Sitting next to the window, on the drop off side of the road, I commented to my mom that she was passing perilously close to some of the boulders. She failed to heed my warning and then, with a terrible scraping sound she sideswiped one of the jagged rocks. She swerved off the road, jumped out, and literally began tearing at her hair. I’d heard of people doing that but had never actually seen it. I had just gotten my driver’s license, but I suggested that I take over the driving, and no one demurred. On top of everything else, we had to back-track to retrieve my dad’s glasses, which he had left behind.

        Finally, we arrived at the ferry landing to catch the boat that would take us down the fjord to Bergen.   

        &nbsp;  

        Several hundred cars were lined up patiently waiting for their chance to drive onto the ferry.  
        I drove right by to the front of the line. 
        People honked and shook their fists at us but screw them. We had bigger problems.

        Finally arriving in Bergen, we found our hotel, went into the lobby, and my mom went to check us in. Here events took a dramatic turn and the actual facts are somewhat lost to history. I remember my brother Evan having been entrusted with the careful handling of a carry-on bag containing 5 quarts of whiskey meant for our relatives, and losing his grip, dropped it onto the marble floor of the lobby. Alternatively, there’s a claim that a bell hop had dropped it. Nevertheless, a large pool of alcohol spread out around us. What a sight we must have been! A family with alcoholic parents. My mom's hair and clothing were totally disheveled. My dad's face was contorted in pain as he stood on his new crutches. He snapped, and he swung his crutch wildly at my brother, who took refuge behind a large potted palm. That evening my dad went to the hospital, had the cast sawed off, and a new one put on. It had been a tough day.   

        &nbsp;  

        In the morning, my dad, still hurting but mildly sedated, met up with two fellow stamp collecting buddies who lived in Bergen.

        He was into collecting Norwegian and Icelandic stamps big time and ended up with the world's premiere collection of both. We headed back across Norway, this time via a more southerly route. We stopped at a small village renowned for its goat cheese, which we had been heavily exposed to as youngsters. Unfortunately, I'd OD’d on goat cheese years before.

        We decided to drive all night, but the road was muddy and unpaved. Rain poured down in sheets, and we pulled over on the side of the road to rest at 3:00 AM. At four, from out of nowhere we heard singing, and a troop of Boy Scouts on their bikes pedaled by. I had been a scout, and my dad always told me how tough his people were, but this gung-ho troop peddling away in the rain and mud at 4 A.M. left a big impression on me. Small wonder that at The Winter Olympics, Norwegians take home a disproportionate percentage of the gold medals every time.  

        &nbsp;  

        At length we arrived in Larvik, my dad's hometown. We met up with relatives and relaxed.

        Visiting a steady stream of relatives, we were served cookies, cake, and sweets at every stop. Most spoke English, but I couldn't keep the identities of all my people straight. I did know Henry Flaaten, who had stayed with us in Chicago during the war.  

        &nbsp;  

        One elderly couple, Stevanus and Luisa, sat quietly and spoke no English. They were super religious, and I was told they took a different person from the local mental hospital into their home every weekend.

        We’d had a good time, the front and back of the Citroen had been repaired, and my dad had been happily distracted seeing all his people. We hopped the ferry there in Larvik headed towards Frederikshavn, and it was Denmark here we come. Familial tensions remained high. My dad insisted on taking a turn at driving in Copenhagen. Between not being very experienced behind the wheel, and with a strange shift and clutch, plus the cast on his foot, he put the car in forward instead of reverse in the parking lot. The car lurched forward and crashed into a lattice fence causing some damage. As I remember, my mom took over and we left quickly. The incident probably could be termed as a hit and run.

        The water was clear and swimmable in those days. Dad ventured out on the beach; a plastic bag taped over his cast. He managed to lie down on a chaise lounge on the beach.  

        &nbsp;  

        We went into the water, fooling around and having a great time.  

        &nbsp;  

        The tide slowly took us further down the beach. Then, remembering dad, who we'd lost sight of, we ran up the beach to find out find how he was doing. He hadn’t been in the sun for decades and his big white body had turned beet red. He had made a brave attempt to escape the sun, but his crutches sank deeply in the sand, and he fell just short of the wooden catwalk. Unable to get up, the inside of the bag on his cast was covered in droplets of condensation and he was badly sunburned. No one had stopped to offer help. We got him back to the hotel, but he was in misery.

        A few days later we headed south down the Adriatic Coast. We had lunch at a seaside restaurant. At first the waiter seemed proficient in English, and we each ordered lunch. It was enjoyable, but when the bill came my dad had questions about the addition. The waiter suddenly forgot all his English. My dad asked about the items on the check. Tough questions - what’s this? That’s the silverware, $2.50. That's the napkins, the glasses, the salt and pepper, etc. Typical Italian style shit in those days. Since the waiter was no longer able to understand English, my dad simply said “police”, and while the hysterical Italian waiter raved on, he repeated himself - "we want to go to the police”. With angry invective, the bill was cut in half and we exited.

        We headed to Rome, but at this point the minds of the surviving members of the expedition seemed to have grown foggy. For some reason there are no pictures to prove that we even went there. But my mom’s diary provides some clarity. Apparently, we visited the catacombs, The Colosseum, Saint Peter’s and my sister remembers the Trevi Fountain. Dim memories. After that we did head north and here is my brother holding up the tower of Pisa.

        We got news our car had finally arrived in Goteborg, and my dad went back to Sweden to pick up our Citroen. In addition to the front bumper being taped on because of the collision in France, the car had been rear-ended on the road with my dad behind the wheel on the way to Oslo. Into the repair shop it went.  

        Here’s a picture of the car after the repairs had been made.

The road narrowed and then water appeared far below on one side. Huge jagged boulders had been placed on the edge of the road to keep travelers from falling over the precipice to their certain deaths. My dad's pain was intensifying.

        Finally arriving in Bergen, we found our hotel, went into the lobby, and my mom went to check us in. Here events took a dramatic turn and the actual facts are somewhat lost to history. I remember my brother Evan having been entrusted with the careful handling of a carry-on bag containing 5 quarts of whiskey meant for our relatives, and losing his grip, dropped it onto the marble floor of the lobby. Alternatively, there’s a claim that a bell hop had dropped it. Nevertheless, a large pool of alcohol spread out around us. What a sight we must have been! A family with alcoholic parents. My mom's hair and clothing were totally disheveled. My dad's face was contorted in pain as he stood on his new crutches. He snapped, and he swung his crutch wildly at my brother, who took refuge behind a large potted palm. That evening my dad went to the hospital, had the cast sawed off, and a new one put on. It had been a tough day.

        We decided to drive all night, but the road was muddy and unpaved. Rain poured down in sheets, and we pulled over on the side of the road to rest at 3:00 AM. At four, from out of nowhere we heard singing, and a troop of Boy Scouts on their bikes pedaled by. I had been a scout, and my dad always told me how tough his people were, but this gung-ho troop peddling away in the rain and mud at 4 A.M. left a big impression on me. Small wonder that at The Winter Olympics, Norwegians take home a disproportionate percentage of the gold medals every time.  

        &nbsp;  

        At length we arrived in Larvik, my dad's hometown. We met up with relatives and relaxed.

        Visiting a steady stream of relatives, we were served cookies, cake, and sweets at every stop. Most spoke English, but I couldn't keep the identities of all my people straight. I did know Henry Flaaten, who had stayed with us in Chicago during the war.  

        &nbsp;  

        One elderly couple, Stevanus and Luisa, sat quietly and spoke no English. They were super religious, and I was told they took a different person from the local mental hospital into their home every weekend.

        We’d had a good time, the front and back of the Citroen had been repaired, and my dad had been happily distracted seeing all his people. We hopped the ferry there in Larvik headed towards Frederikshavn, and it was Denmark here we come. Familial tensions remained high. My dad insisted on taking a turn at driving in Copenhagen. Between not being very experienced behind the wheel, and with a strange shift and clutch, plus the cast on his foot, he put the car in forward instead of reverse in the parking lot. The car lurched forward and crashed into a lattice fence causing some damage. As I remember, my mom took over and we left quickly. The incident probably could be termed as a hit and run.

        The water was clear and swimmable in those days. Dad ventured out on the beach; a plastic bag taped over his cast. He managed to lie down on a chaise lounge on the beach.  

        &nbsp;  

        We went into the water, fooling around and having a great time.  

        &nbsp;  

        The tide slowly took us further down the beach. Then, remembering dad, who we'd lost sight of, we ran up the beach to find out find how he was doing. He hadn’t been in the sun for decades and his big white body had turned beet red. He had made a brave attempt to escape the sun, but his crutches sank deeply in the sand, and he fell just short of the wooden catwalk. Unable to get up, the inside of the bag on his cast was covered in droplets of condensation and he was badly sunburned. No one had stopped to offer help. We got him back to the hotel, but he was in misery.

        A few days later we headed south down the Adriatic Coast. We had lunch at a seaside restaurant. At first the waiter seemed proficient in English, and we each ordered lunch. It was enjoyable, but when the bill came my dad had questions about the addition. The waiter suddenly forgot all his English. My dad asked about the items on the check. Tough questions - what’s this? That’s the silverware, $2.50. That's the napkins, the glasses, the salt and pepper, etc. Typical Italian style shit in those days. Since the waiter was no longer able to understand English, my dad simply said “police”, and while the hysterical Italian waiter raved on, he repeated himself - "we want to go to the police”. With angry invective, the bill was cut in half and we exited.

But my mom’s diary provides some clarity. Apparently, we visited the catacombs, The Colosseum, Saint Peter’s and my sister remembers the Trevi Fountain. Dim memories. After that we did head north and here is my brother holding up the tower of Pisa.

        I agreed to go somewhat reluctantly. I was a freshman in college. Bearing in mind the age difference between a 19-year-old adolescent and a seven-year-old sister, with a brother in between, we were a somewhat disparate group. But we all departed from New York City aboard the Kungsholm together and headed out across the Atlantic toward Europe.  
        We had the perfunctory lifeboat drill and put on our flotation devices.

        A high point of the cruise was my little sister winning two consecutive bingo games. The passengers thought it was so cute when she won the first game, but not so much the second. She won one hundred and fifty dollars. There was widespread grumbling on the part of the competition. Cute only goes so far. My parents had been in touch with a Citroen dealer in France and arranged to have the car delivered to us on the dock in Goteborg, Sweden, when we disembarked. But when we arrived, there was no one to meet us and no car. One by one everyone left, and they closed the place up, leaving us alone on the dock with our luggage. After much frantic phoning we finally learned the French driver had been in an accident en-route, damaging our car and necessitating some quick repairs.  
        We stayed overnight in Goteborg.

At four, from out of nowhere we heard singing, and a troop of Boy Scouts on their bikes pedaled by. I had been a scout, and my dad always told me how tough his people were, but this gung-ho troop peddling away in the rain and mud at 4 A.M. left a big impression on me. Small wonder that at The Winter Olympics, Norwegians take home a disproportionate percentage of the gold medals every time.  

        &nbsp;  

        At length we arrived in Larvik, my dad's hometown. We met up with relatives and relaxed.

        Visiting a steady stream of relatives, we were served cookies, cake, and sweets at every stop. Most spoke English, but I couldn't keep the identities of all my people straight. I did know Henry Flaaten, who had stayed with us in Chicago during the war.

        We’d had a good time, the front and back of the Citroen had been repaired, and my dad had been happily distracted seeing all his people. We hopped the ferry there in Larvik headed towards Frederikshavn, and it was Denmark here we come. Familial tensions remained high. My dad insisted on taking a turn at driving in Copenhagen. Between not being very experienced behind the wheel, and with a strange shift and clutch, plus the cast on his foot, he put the car in forward instead of reverse in the parking lot. The car lurched forward and crashed into a lattice fence causing some damage. As I remember, my mom took over and we left quickly. The incident probably could be termed as a hit and run.

        The water was clear and swimmable in those days. Dad ventured out on the beach; a plastic bag taped over his cast. He managed to lie down on a chaise lounge on the beach.  

        &nbsp;  

        We went into the water, fooling around and having a great time.  

        &nbsp;  

        The tide slowly took us further down the beach. Then, remembering dad, who we'd lost sight of, we ran up the beach to find out find how he was doing. He hadn’t been in the sun for decades and his big white body had turned beet red. He had made a brave attempt to escape the sun, but his crutches sank deeply in the sand, and he fell just short of the wooden catwalk. Unable to get up, the inside of the bag on his cast was covered in droplets of condensation and he was badly sunburned. No one had stopped to offer help. We got him back to the hotel, but he was in misery.

        A few days later we headed south down the Adriatic Coast. We had lunch at a seaside restaurant. At first the waiter seemed proficient in English, and we each ordered lunch. It was enjoyable, but when the bill came my dad had questions about the addition. The waiter suddenly forgot all his English. My dad asked about the items on the check. Tough questions - what’s this? That’s the silverware, $2.50. That's the napkins, the glasses, the salt and pepper, etc. Typical Italian style shit in those days. Since the waiter was no longer able to understand English, my dad simply said “police”, and while the hysterical Italian waiter raved on, he repeated himself - "we want to go to the police”. With angry invective, the bill was cut in half and we exited.

        We headed to Rome, but at this point the minds of the surviving members of the expedition seemed to have grown foggy. For some reason there are no pictures to prove that we even went there. But my mom’s diary provides some clarity. Apparently, we visited the catacombs, The Colosseum, Saint Peter’s and my sister remembers the Trevi Fountain. Dim memories. After that we did head north and here is my brother holding up the tower of Pisa.

        After 2 months the trip finally came to an end and we headed to the airport. We’d had a pretty good time despite all our trials and tribulations. But it has to be said it wasn't an entirely buoyant and happily relaxed familial unit that headed back home.

        I agreed to go somewhat reluctantly. I was a freshman in college. Bearing in mind the age difference between a 19-year-old adolescent and a seven-year-old sister, with a brother in between, we were a somewhat disparate group. But we all departed from New York City aboard the Kungsholm together and headed out across the Atlantic toward Europe.  
        We had the perfunctory lifeboat drill and put on our flotation devices.

        A high point of the cruise was my little sister winning two consecutive bingo games. The passengers thought it was so cute when she won the first game, but not so much the second. She won one hundred and fifty dollars. There was widespread grumbling on the part of the competition. Cute only goes so far. My parents had been in touch with a Citroen dealer in France and arranged to have the car delivered to us on the dock in Goteborg, Sweden, when we disembarked. But when we arrived, there was no one to meet us and no car. One by one everyone left, and they closed the place up, leaving us alone on the dock with our luggage. After much frantic phoning we finally learned the French driver had been in an accident en-route, damaging our car and necessitating some quick repairs.  
        We stayed overnight in Goteborg.

        We got news our car had finally arrived in Goteborg, and my dad went back to Sweden to pick up our Citroen. In addition to the front bumper being taped on because of the collision in France, the car had been rear-ended on the road with my dad behind the wheel on the way to Oslo. Into the repair shop it went.  
        Here’s a picture of the car after the repairs had been made.

        We stopped overnight, and the next morning my dad, my brother, and I decided to hike down to the river with borrowed equipment and try our luck fishing. It was a tough slog and halfway down my dad who was older, a little overweight, and out of shape, tripped stepping over a big log and fell heavily to the ground. An audible cracking sound emanated from his foot. As he lay there in agony, his eyes glazed over, and he uttered what became an evergreen of familial hilarity in later years. He said ‘’have fun-go fishing “. To get him back up the trail, it took four strong Norwegians with some minor assistance on my part. Needless to say, the incident was to cast a dark pall over the exciting family vacation that was barely underway. They gave us directions to the nearest medical clinic some distance up the mountain road.

        My dad was taken inside and emerged sometime later with crutches and a large cast on his foot. We continued on our way, my mom at the wheel, and my dad moaning softly in the front seat. The road narrowed and then water appeared far below on one side. Huge jagged boulders had been placed on the edge of the road to keep travelers from falling over the precipice to their certain deaths. My dad's pain was intensifying. Apparently, the cast had been applied prematurely and his broken foot was continuing to swell in the confines of the cast. Sitting next to the window, on the drop off side of the road, I commented to my mom that she was passing perilously close to some of the boulders. She failed to heed my warning and then, with a terrible scraping sound she sideswiped one of the jagged rocks. She swerved off the road, jumped out, and literally began tearing at her hair. I’d heard of people doing that but had never actually seen it. I had just gotten my driver’s license, but I suggested that I take over the driving, and no one demurred. On top of everything else, we had to back-track to retrieve my dad’s glasses, which he had left behind.

        Finally, we arrived at the ferry landing to catch the boat that would take us down the fjord to Bergen.   

        &nbsp;  

        Several hundred cars were lined up patiently waiting for their chance to drive onto the ferry.  
        I drove right by to the front of the line. People honked and shook their fists at us but screw them. We had bigger problems.

        Finally arriving in Bergen, we found our hotel, went into the lobby, and my mom went to check us in. Here events took a dramatic turn and the actual facts are somewhat lost to history. I remember my brother Evan having been entrusted with the careful handling of a carry-on bag containing 5 quarts of whiskey meant for our relatives, and losing his grip, dropped it onto the marble floor of the lobby. Alternatively, there’s a claim that a bell hop had dropped it. Nevertheless, a large pool of alcohol spread out around us. What a sight we must have been! A family with alcoholic parents. My mom's hair and clothing were totally disheveled. My dad's face was contorted in pain as he stood on his new crutches. He snapped, and he swung his crutch wildly at my brother, who took refuge behind a large potted palm. That evening my dad went to the hospital, had the cast sawed off, and a new one put on. It had been a tough day.   

        &nbsp;  

        In the morning, my dad, still hurting but mildly sedated, met up with two fellow stamp collecting buddies who lived in Bergen.

        He was into collecting Norwegian and Icelandic stamps big time and ended up with the world's premiere collection of both. We headed back across Norway, this time via a more southerly route. We stopped at a small village renowned for its goat cheese, which we had been heavily exposed to as youngsters. Unfortunately, I'd OD’d on goat cheese years before.

        The water was clear and swimmable in those days. Dad ventured out on the beach; a plastic bag taped over his cast. He managed to lie down on a chaise lounge on the beach.  

        &nbsp;  

        We went into the water, fooling around and having a great time.  

        &nbsp;  

        The tide slowly took us further down the beach. Then, remembering dad, who we'd lost sight of, we ran up the beach to find out find how he was doing. He hadn’t been in the sun for decades and his big white body had turned beet red. He had made a brave attempt to escape the sun, but his crutches sank deeply in the sand, and he fell just short of the wooden catwalk. Unable to get up, the inside of the bag on his cast was covered in droplets of condensation and he was badly sunburned. No one had stopped to offer help. We got him back to the hotel, but he was in misery.

        A few days later we headed south down the Adriatic Coast. We had lunch at a seaside restaurant. At first the waiter seemed proficient in English, and we each ordered lunch. It was enjoyable, but when the bill came my dad had questions about the addition. The waiter suddenly forgot all his English. My dad asked about the items on the check. Tough questions - what’s this? That’s the silverware, $2.50. That's the napkins, the glasses, the salt and pepper, etc. Typical Italian style shit in those days. Since the waiter was no longer able to understand English, my dad simply said “police”, and while the hysterical Italian waiter raved on, he repeated himself - "we want to go to the police”. With angry invective, the bill was cut in half and we exited.

        We headed to Rome, but at this point the minds of the surviving members of the expedition seemed to have grown foggy. For some reason there are no pictures to prove that we even went there. But my mom’s diary provides some clarity. Apparently, we visited the catacombs, The Colosseum, Saint Peter’s and my sister remembers the Trevi Fountain. Dim memories. After that we did head north and here is my brother holding up the tower of Pisa.

        We dropped off our Citroen there in Paris and took the train to London via the famous “Night Ferry”, which loaded your railcar on and off the ferry in the middle of the night. We took a bus tour of some high points in London.

        After 2 months the trip finally came to an end and we headed to the airport. We’d had a pretty good time despite all our trials and tribulations. But it has to be said it wasn't an entirely buoyant and happily relaxed familial unit that headed back home.
