        My dad was named Jarl, or Earl in English. His parents Thorbjörn and Anna immigrated to Chicago from Norway in 1903. When they first arrived in Chicago, Thorbjörn got a job as a bicycle repairman, a job far below his skill level. He'd been the superintendent and manager of a machine fabrication factory back in Norway.

        Soon after they arrived Chicago, my dad was born, but in 1908 his parents made the decision to return to the old country with their young boy, who was then three. He told me some stories from his boyhood there. He and his dad would pedal their bikes into the woods in the spring and return with gallons of blueberries.

        It snowed a lot, and many mornings when they opened the front door, they were confronted with deep snow that had fallen overnight. He had to shovel his way out and take snowshoes or skis to get to school. It was a long ways away.

        Once as a boy he ran into a skunk and got sprayed badly, and yelling for his mom, he ran for home. She heard him coming and from across the yard she told him to stop right there by the gate, dig a hole, take off his clothes, and bury them there. Anna went to get some warm water and brought soap and a big galvanized tub to wash him down.

        He had a summer job breaking congealed oil from the walls deep in the bowels of the whale oil tankers. Once, overcome by fumes, he passed out, and had to be quickly hoisted to safety above deck. Many of our relatives on my dad’s side were in the whaling business.

        Returning from Antarctica every season, the fleet stopped to refuel in Brazil and brought oranges home for the kids at Christmas. He remembered that a single orange was the best Christmas present he got each year. A famous harpoonist in our family had killed more whales with his right arm than any man that had ever lived.

        Being Norwegian he was big on winter sports. As a boy he skied, but as he got older speed skating became his thing. He got so good at it that he appeared in some exhibition shows with the world-famous skater Sonja Henie. He was strong and threw the shotput. He worked for a summer as a draftsman in his dad's factory. One day Thorbjörn put his hand on his son’s shoulder and told him, “Earl you've got to think of something else to do. You're looking up at the clock too much”.

        He was a top student and decided to study history. But after pursuing that possibility in school for a time, he changed his mind. Later, my dad said, “My hands won't leave me alone”. So, at age 20, in 1926, he headed back to the states to study dentistry. He went back to Chicago to the University of Illinois dental school. Earl was a US citizen by birth, but as they say, you can't take Norway out of the boy. Although I couldn't hear it myself, my friends told me he had a pretty heavy Norwegian accent.

        My dad met a man named Dietrich Lunde, and by chance he and his wife both hailed from the same little town where my dad and his folks had lived. So, Dietrich, who had five children, insisted they all go to Doctor Jacobsen, who was to be the family dentist. The youngest of the Lunde kids was named Elsie. She was a teenager, and had worn braces on her teeth, but my dad thought they had been removed too soon and suggested to her father that they be reapplied. He agreed and with that, Doctor Jacobsen zoomed to the top of Elsie’s shit list pronto!

        Once as a boy he ran into a skunk and got sprayed badly, and yelling for his mom, he ran for home. She heard him coming and from across the yard she told him to stop right there by the gate, dig a hole, take off his clothes, and bury them there. Anna went to get some warm water and brought soap and a big galvanized tub to wash him down.

        Returning from Antarctica every season, the fleet stopped to refuel in Brazil and brought oranges home for the kids at Christmas. He remembered that a single orange was the best Christmas present he got each year. A famous harpoonist in our family had killed more whales with his right arm than any man that had ever lived.

        Being Norwegian he was big on winter sports. As a boy he skied, but as he got older speed skating became his thing. He got so good at it that he appeared in some exhibition shows with the world-famous skater Sonja Henie. He was strong and threw the shotput. He worked for a summer as a draftsman in his dad's factory. One day Thorbjörn put his hand on his son’s shoulder and told him, “Earl you've got to think of something else to do. You're looking up at the clock too much”.

        He was a top student and decided to study history. But after pursuing that possibility in school for a time, he changed his mind. Later, my dad said, “My hands won't leave me alone”. So, at age 20, in 1926, he headed back to the states to study dentistry. He went back to Chicago to the University of Illinois dental school. Earl was a US citizen by birth, but as they say, you can't take Norway out of the boy. Although I couldn't hear it myself, my friends told me he had a pretty heavy Norwegian accent.

        My dad was named Jarl, or Earl in English. His parents Thorbjörn and Anna immigrated to Chicago from Norway in 1903. When they first arrived in Chicago, Thorbjörn got a job as a bicycle repairman, a job far below his skill level. He'd been the superintendent and manager of a machine fabrication factory back in Norway.

        Soon after they arrived Chicago, my dad was born, but in 1908 his parents made the decision to return to the old country with their young boy, who was then three. He told me some stories from his boyhood there. He and his dad would pedal their bikes into the woods in the spring and return with gallons of blueberries.

        My dad was named Jarl, or Earl in English. His parents Thorbjörn and Anna immigrated to Chicago from Norway in 1903. When they first arrived in Chicago, Thorbjörn got a job as a bicycle repairman, a job far below his skill level. He'd been the superintendent and manager of a machine fabrication factory back in Norway.

        Soon after they arrived Chicago, my dad was born, but in 1908 his parents made the decision to return to the old country with their young boy, who was then three. He told me some stories from his boyhood there. He and his dad would pedal their bikes into the woods in the spring and return with gallons of blueberries.

        It snowed a lot, and many mornings when they opened the front door, they were confronted with deep snow that had fallen overnight. He had to shovel his way out and take snowshoes or skis to get to school. It was a long ways away.

        Once as a boy he ran into a skunk and got sprayed badly, and yelling for his mom, he ran for home. She heard him coming and from across the yard she told him to stop right there by the gate, dig a hole, take off his clothes, and bury them there. Anna went to get some warm water and brought soap and a big galvanized tub to wash him down.

        He had a summer job breaking congealed oil from the walls deep in the bowels of the whale oil tankers. Once, overcome by fumes, he passed out, and had to be quickly hoisted to safety above deck. Many of our relatives on my dad’s side were in the whaling business.

        Returning from Antarctica every season, the fleet stopped to refuel in Brazil and brought oranges home for the kids at Christmas. He remembered that a single orange was the best Christmas present he got each year. A famous harpoonist in our family had killed more whales with his right arm than any man that had ever lived.

        Being Norwegian he was big on winter sports. As a boy he skied, but as he got older speed skating became his thing. He got so good at it that he appeared in some exhibition shows with the world-famous skater Sonja Henie. He was strong and threw the shotput.

        He worked for a summer as a draftsman in his dad's factory. One day Thorbjörn put his hand on his son’s shoulder and told him, “Earl you've got to think of something else to do. You're looking up at the clock too much”.

        He was a top student and decided to study history. But after pursuing that possibility in school for a time, he changed his mind. Later, my dad said, “My hands won't leave me alone”. So, at age 20, in 1926, he headed back to the states to study dentistry.

        He went back to Chicago to the University of Illinois dental school. Earl was a US citizen by birth, but as they say, you can't take Norway out of the boy. Although I couldn't hear it myself, my friends told me he had a pretty heavy Norwegian accent.

        Soon after he came, his parents and his brother Wesley joined him in Chicago. He made his way through dental school, earning good money by working as a “roughneck”, “walking the girders”, constructing skyscrapers high above the city with no harnesses or safety ropes.

        Earl visited his dad in the hospital the morning of his final school exam. Thorbjörn was preparing to undergo surgery that afternoon and told Earl, "The doctor doesn't know what he'll find, but if it's not good, this will be our final goodbye." And it was.

        So, he started his dental practice in the Chicago loop as the depression took hold. One of his patients had to pay him with bushels of apples. Like most immigrant ethnic groups do, the Norwegians in Chicago looked out for each other.

        My dad met a man named Dietrich Lunde, and by chance he and his wife both hailed from the same little town where my dad and his folks had lived. So, Dietrich, who had five children, insisted they all go to Doctor Jacobsen, who was to be the family dentist.

        The youngest of the Lunde kids was named Elsie. She was a teenager, and had worn braces on her teeth, but my dad thought they had been removed too soon and suggested to her father that they be reapplied. He agreed and with that, Doctor Jacobsen zoomed to the top of Elsie’s shit list pronto!

        Earl had a short fling with Elsie's older sister Ruth. Elsie had visited Norway, and had fallen for a handsome young guy, but her parents, who were very conservative, put the kibosh on even communicating further with him on her return to the States. Elsie was moping around.

        Her mom insisted she had to go to the dance at the Country Club, but there was no one she wanted to go with. Her mom suggested Doctor Jacobsen. So, she reluctantly agreed, and that date was the beginning of a magical lifelong relationship between the two.

        The lovebirds got married in 1938 and little Erik joined them in 1940. My parents were both Phi Beta Kappa and they threw themselves into parenting whole hog.

        We played chess when my dad came home from work. He helped me memorize every bird in Audubon book. My dad took me fishing. I wasn't allowed to litter, swear, or use any racially derogatory terms. He poured himself into educating me.

        He was raising Siamese fighting fish, trying to produce one that was cornflower blue. I started collecting butterflies and moths and he made a beautiful butterfly net for me. Some nights we went sugaring for moths.

        My dad had lots of old sayings he used on me regularly. “I didn't know they could pile it so high”. “The things you can get your mouth to say”. “You’d lose your head if it wasn't screwed on”. “You don't have the sense God gave a grasshopper”. Stuff like that.

        He got angry with me one night when he thought I was old enough to understand. He said to me “See this face”? His eyes narrowed, and his face tightened with a fearsome intensity, and it portrayed an air of dangerous foreboding.

        He said “Erik, when I look at you like this, think of what you're doing and stop it. Because if you don’t, we’ll go upstairs, I’ll pull down your pants, take you over my knee and spank your fanny so hard my hand will hurt”. A word to the wise. I never pushed it and it never happened.

        He helped me learn to ride a bike. He took us skiing and skating, but my ankles were too skinny. Our family went on wonderful trips together. He was a loving husband to my mom and encouraged her in all her extracurricular endeavors.

        My dad was fascinated with the new theory of plate tectonics, discoveries in the fossil record, comparative philosophy and religion. Having been subjected to strong Lutheran overtones in his youth, it wasn’t entirely surprising that he ended up as an atheist.

        Shortly thereafter Earl began feeling ill and had a pain in his hip. He took a short trip to Norway to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his graduating class, but he was feeling “too rotten” as he used to say, to have a good time. He was diagnosed with lymphoma. He died in 1974 at the age of 69. I was a lucky son to have a dad like him.
