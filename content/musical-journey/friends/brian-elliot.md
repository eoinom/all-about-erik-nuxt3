A guy walked into my office on Kearny Street, claiming to be a songwriter. He had met Peter Kraemer of the Sopwith Camel, who had sent him over to see me. I agreed to listen to a few of his songs, and after I did he asked me what I thought. I said “good parts, maybe the melody doesn’t open quite right in this chorus, maybe the idea behind these lyrics can take the narrative a little further, and how about a bridge for this one”? He listened but seemed somewhat skeptical and left saying he would think about my comments. Surprisingly, he called the very next day and said he’d done rewrites on the songs and would I listen again? I never had that happen before or since. I listened and was impressed by the changes he’d made. He played a few more songs and we began almost daily conversations about his work. Some of the songs were very funny.

He lived over a poultry market in Chinatown close to my office. He worked at his piano day and night, only one ring away on the phone. He drank cup after cup of strong Italian coffee. So much so, that he was actually cut off at the source by his local caffeine connection for the sake of his health. His face had broken out in small coffee induced blotches.

We recorded a demo. He sang and played piano, but the vocals weren’t that great. In terms of a potential recording deal that presented a problem. But as easy as it was to be critical of Warner's promo department, it must be said there were a lot of intelligent guys down there at the company, and by and large, they were a good-humored bunch. So I proposed to Mo that we do a live audition for them. Mo set us up in a room with a piano. A half dozen of the movers and shakers came to listen to Brian’s funny songs. They loved the material! They rhapsodized about Brian being on SNL every other week, and gave us a record deal. We went into the studio. Brian was coming up with new material, but the songs were getting more poppy and less humorous. By the time we finished, Greg Steckler had become Brian Elliot, and it wasn’t the comedy type album Warner Brothers had hoped for. The record came out and quickly sank beneath the waves.

Brian kept on writing more pop sounding tracks, and we made an album with a gal named Christina Viera. We played it for Micheal Ostin, and although he wasn’t super impressed with Christina, he had the brilliant idea of playing one of the songs,” Papa Don’t Preach,” for Madonna. She loved it but she wanted to add a couple more lines to the first verse, and also demanded a 20% cut of the writer’s royalties. Understandably this really rubbed us the wrong way, and it took a lot of convincing to get him to agree to the deal. He finally gave in, and that turned out to be a wise decision because the record she made of the song went on to sell 100 million copies.

He kept on working on new material. We had so much fun together at these sessions. Brian cooked up great food, we drank wildly and argued politics. Chris Isaak and Brian wrote a handful of songs together, but Chris only recorded one, called “Can’t Do a Thing to Stop Me.”

We had nothing going commercially. We found a singer named Nadia Finkelstein and we recorded her doing new songs as Brain was turning them out. The material sounded good to me, and we brought a demo around to a dozen record companies, but it failed to impress. We were up against the headwinds created by a new wave of teenage girl singers. Nadia was in her mid-twenties.

So Brian and I started talking about him going live with a set of funny new songs. We had a good time recording. Many of the arrangements were kind of jazzy sounding, with him playing the piano. Meanwhile, he was playing happy hour at a bar in Glendale, so time working on the new tunes was somewhat limited. But we finally got a set’s worth of material together, and we got the old Warner Brothers PR genius, Bob Merlis, to agree to help us. He insisted that Brian would have to do some showcase gigs in order to get some record companies interested. We weren’t sure what venue would be right. Then Brian hurt his hand, and it wasn’t so easy for him to play the piano. And he wasn’t a young man anymore. The material was mainly humorous but some of the songs were a little bit on the esoteric side. Between these factors, our great plans slowly lost steam, and then just faded away.

The songs still sound funny and we’ve had 40 years of good times working together. If you spend a lifetime writing songs and end up being a one-hit wonder, selling 100 million copies of that hit that’s still pretty darn good.
