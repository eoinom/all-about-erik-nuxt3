My friendship with Henry started when we met as fellow banjo players at a rehearsal for a tour we were going out on called the “Traveling Hootenanny”. His group was the Modern Folk Quartet, MFQ for short, and mine was the Knoblick Upper 10,000. Bessie Griffin and the Gospel Pearls, and Lynn Gold, a girl folk singer, were also on the bill. Lou Gottlieb, the ex Limeliter, was our announcer. The tour was a long and brutal 40-day trip on a bus. We went North, South, East and West, with only a couple of motel stops thrown in. For our show in Boston, the auditorium was almost empty when we played. At the end of our show, when we all joined hands and sang “We Shall Overcome” together, we literally outnumbered the members of the audience. The old backdrop behind us said, “Dog Show 1932”. Disconcertingly, down south, Bessie and her group couldn’t eat or stay at the same places we did. In Southern California, Lynn Golds’ guitar was wrestled away from her and repossessed right on the stage in the middle of her set. She walked off sobbing, and quit the tour then and there. For me, the most notable memory of the trip was the MFQ turning me on to pot for the first time. 

Henry and I both lived in New York City and shortly after our mutual groups split up, we shared an apartment at 97 McDougal Street in the Village. I was working with the Spoonful and we had our first hit going. Henry was at loose ends, no group and no career. But he had a camera, so I offered to send him out on the road with the Spoonful and take pictures. A real job with a salary and per-diems! He took me up on it, and he began taking photos. From those beginnings, he’s gone on to be considered a bonafide professional snapshot artist! In the mid-60s he planned to get married and decorated and furnished an apartment at 350 Bleecker Street, but the nuptials fell through. He gave me the apartment and moved to LA. I moved out of 97 McDougal.

We’ve stayed close over the years, and when I was recording down there in L.A., I stayed in his homes in Laurel Canyon and North Hollywood hundreds of times. We’ve always had fun together and we’ve never had an argument. He just won’t go there! He’s taken lots of pictures of me, and today his vast archives document the lives and careers of so many people. Now he’s a real big-wig photographer, in high demand, with shows and galleries and appearances on TV. As anyone who knows him will attest, he’s a one in a million-type guy. Funny, talented, and above all possessed of boundless optimism, patience, and good humor. He’s been a terrific buddy for over half a century.
