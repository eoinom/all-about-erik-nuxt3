---
A guy called me from Mississippi and asked if I’d listen to his group. They called themselves the Wallabies. I said, sure, send me a tape of your three best songs. The tape was ok, but he had his heart set on the band coming out to California to play live for me. I couldn’t dissuade him, and three days later he and the group showed up. They auditioned for me at our Sausalito heliport rehearsal hall. I didn’t think the band was very good in person either, not the guitar, the singers, or the songs. When I related my opinion to Alex, he said, okay then, I’m going to tell the guys we’re disbanding. And they broke up on the spot.



He asked me what I was up to, and I told him I was between recordings and working on my houseboat in Sausalito. He claimed he was a carpenter, plumber, and an electrician and he was willing to help me work on the houseboat for free. He came over with his sleeping bag and said he would just crash on the floor of the unfinished Blue Goose. It didn’t even have a roof! He insisted we get carpenter’s overalls. Working together we became buddies, and he was able to do everything he claimed. When the houseboat was done he moved into San Francisco, got in the acid business, and became known as “Magic Alex.”



He went back to Colorado, got married and had a baby boy who tragically died shortly before his third birthday. Alex started a retail boutique kitchen store called “Earthly Goods” in Boulder, Colorado. It was a big success. But as a musician he wanted to be involved with music again, so he started a recording studio called “Northstar” and several hit groups recorded there.



Then two guys came in with an artist that they wanted to record, and they brought him into Alex’s studio. While they were working and hanging out, they sniffed coke and smoked weed together. Little did Alex know that these two new buddies, the Schaeffer brothers, were the biggest pot importing entrepreneurs on the West Coast at that time. And they loved Alex, a smart, visionary, irrepressible guy with a big head of red hair. He was a great promoter, and as they say, he could sell ice to an Eskimo. So, they ended up offering him the job of managing their finances. Hundreds of millions of dollars! The brothers imported a mother ship of Thai sticks every year – hundreds of tons. The goods were off-loaded in smaller fishing boats near Portland.



Once Alex got his hands on the checkbook he went nuts! He bought a fleet of 20 airplanes, including the first executive turbo jet ever built, the Beechcraft King Air, serial number LJ1. He also got a couple of jets in the deal. In LA one time, Isaak was hot for a beautiful gal but couldn’t make any headway with her. Alex took her to dinner, and asked if she liked Italy? Of course, she did. So, Al proposed the two of them head out to Sardinia and go for a cruise on his yacht. She asked when. “Why not right now? Let’s go by your house and you can pack.” But how will we get there? “In my jet,” says Alex. “It’s at the Burbank airport and we can leave any time we want.” She went. That was Alex for you.



With the brother’s funds, he bought a penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park, where I stayed many times. He bought a cool building in a posh section of London. A beautiful apartment on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. A pink champagne vineyard with a great old house in Provence. Meanwhile, he set his mind on opening the most technically advanced film and music studio in the world, and he planned to call it Metropolis Studios.  He personally appeared before the New York City Council and convinced them to sell him the iconic high school that had been the setting for the famous film “Black Board Jungle”, for a million dollars. Then he bought the parking lot behind the school and with several partners, actually owned one square city block of the upper Westside of Manhattan!



Things were going so well. He dated the most gorgeous models in the world. He had coke, the girls knew it and he was a charming and handsome dude. When we went out together with this crowd together, I always felt semitransparent.



But it was all too good to be true, and suddenly everything fell apart. Their hugely successful drug import conspiracy had been voluntarily terminated several years before. But as it happened, two drunken fishermen that had each helped off-load the goods some years before, got into some kind of argument and ended up brawling in a bar. Questioned separately by the police about the cause of the dispute, it turned out that the argument had centered on who had gotten paid the most for ferrying the tons of Thai sticks ashore.  An investigation was opened, the accountant for the entire enterprise was popped, and seeking a lighter sentence, implicated everybody.



The feds confiscated everything they could find of value, lock, stock, and barrel. Alex was named along with 16 others in the conspiracy. It seems he had flown many brown boxes to Switzerland in his jet, and although he claimed he had no knowledge as to what the boxes contained, he acted like a smart-ass to the prosecutor and the guy marked him for special attention. Although he fought the charges tooth and nail, ultimately firing three different lawyers and borrowing tens of thousands of dollars to pay his legal team, it was all in vain. All 15 co-conspirators were arrested and they all testified against him. He was sentenced to a five-year prison term in Lompoc prison. He had blown through 17 million.



When he got out, he immediately began plotting and planning how to get rich again, and he embarked on what turned out to be 30 year quest. He had one visionary scheme after another.



Flax cloth and paper, an online bank. He convinced the Norwegian government he would buy Ford’s early electric car manufacturing plant there, but couldn’t pull the finances together. A solar powered ferry for SF. A shipyard. Rebuilt jet engines with sound dampeners built in. Wind farms, solar, algae fuel, batteries, you name it. A million huge and wonderful ideas. He became a spokesperson for the emerging green sustainability movement. He spoke at conferences in Rio, Dubai, India, and Europe. All with boundless enthusiasm, knowledge, and conviction. He was always meeting some new big wigs. He continued pursuing his dream called, “Kings of the Air”. He still owned his old Beechcraft, although it was in parts. He convinced quite a few manufacturers to contribute to it’s reconstruction. He moved the fuselage from hanger to hanger. From Memphis, to Kansas and finally to LA.  After getting it in top shape, he planned on having movie stars help him fly it around the world in short flights, ending at the Smithsonian and gifting it as the example of the first Executive Turbo Jet. Morgan Freeman and Harrison Ford were on board, as well as several others. But he wasn’t able to get the plane together.

Then, a few years ago, a disturbing interlude in his nonstop visionary period of manic optimism found me putting him up in my downstairs apartment for a while. He fell deep into the depressive side of his mentality. I even took him to the emergency ward to try to get medicine to help him cope. He was marginally suicidal.



But after a year he began feeling a little better. I bought him a car and he headed out on the road again. He went to Truth or Consequences New Mexico and bathed in a lithium hot springs daily. He bounced back and would come by occasionally and unveil his latest plans and schemes. As always, so visionary but so out of reach.



Nothing was working. He was living in his car, eating canned fish, and Cup O’ Noodles, parking behind various Walmart’s to sleep at night. His body started to fail him, and he told me, “Erik you always said old age was a nightmare and you were right.” With so many broken dreams, and his health falling apart, Alex fell deeper and deeper into a great dark vortex of depression. It was all too much for him and he couldn't go on. Alex threw himself under a train.
