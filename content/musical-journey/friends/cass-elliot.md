Cass was a big, beautiful gal, sunny and funny with a wonderful voice. We met in the village when she was singing with the Big Three and I was playing banjo with my group. When her group broke up she started singing with Denny Doherty, Zal, and Jim Hendricks in a group they called the Mugwumps. Previously, when I started trying to make records I had recorded various cuts with Cass, Zal, and Denny Doherty. Cass was hilarious, with a special sense of humor. Once, smoking pot in her room at the Albert Hotel with Jack Elliot, I asked him, why do they call you rambling, jack? That struck Cass as so funny, she cracked up. When the Mugwumps broke up, she began planning a solo career. She was managed by my partner Bob Cavallo, and several times I went uptown with her when she went to work with a famous voice coach. Disconcertingly, the walls were totally covered in mirrors. The coach put Cass through her vocal paces. She performed her first shows as a night club chanteuse to a mixed reaction, and shortly thereafter she joined up with the Mamas and the Papas. I went to the studio to hear the playback of their first album. What a great piece of work!

Later, when both the Spoonful and the Mamas and the Papas had hits, we celebrated and drove to uptown Manhattan in a big limousine. It was the first time I ever sniffed coke.

I visited her in LA several times. She was always warm, generous, quick to laugh, sweet, and funny.

It was so sad she was taken so young.
