After I moved back to The Village to stay I started making records, including a demo from a singer I brought down from Boston named Tim Hardin. One day I was playing the demo when a next-door neighbor from across the hall on the 4th-floor walk-up apartment I had rented on Prince Street came over and knocked on the door. He introduced himself as John Sebastian and wanted to know who was singing on the music I was playing. He loved Tim’s voice. I didn’t know John and he played a little guitar and harmonica for me. I was impressed. He said he would love to help record Tim, so along with Felix Pappalardi, Sticks Evans, and Bob Bushnel, we did a long recording session of Tim singing the blues. That recording was released some years later as Tim Hardin 4. 



John and I hung heavy, plotting on our recordings, smoking reefer, and listening to music. We liked a lot of the same stuff – old-timey, country blues, and jug band. One day I asked if he would sing for me. He wasn’t used to doing that, but he did, and I told him he sounded darn good. I asked him to try and write some songs. He had one tune he had worked on as a teenager with his cousin, called “Rooty Toot”, which we recorded. But shortly thereafter, John played me a new one hot off the presses, called, “Warm Baby.” We made a demo of the song, which came out very well. Meanwhile, John was in the studio with me and helped record some of my productions. 



We use to go to the local bakery at 3am and get fresh Italian bread straight out of the oven. We bought weed whenever we could. A guy on the west side named Peter Outlaw was our main supplier for a while. Once, he asked me if anyone I knew had something I wanted? Why? He’d steal it for me. Sharp dressed, with a suit and tie, he peddled drugs to executives from a briefcase both uptown and down. Years later I ran into him on the Spanish steps in Rome. 



One day after scoring what we considered a large amount of weed, maybe a quarter pound, John and I decided to bake some pot brownies. We put quite a few ounces in the batter, and we jumped on the warm brownies the minute they came out of the oven.  We ate an awful lot. On the rooftop of 350 Bleecker, we looked down on the street at all the little people. Things became surreal. We went to see a band play, I think Paul Butterfield, and for me, the whole club was visually oscillating to a disconcerting degree. I barely made it home. 



We had just gotten the guys in the Spoonful together and started to record, when John got some terrible news from the selective service. He was going to be drafted! He was healthy and had no excuse not to go. At that time, married men were exempt from the draft, so John had no choice but to enter into a marriage of convience. We asked a good friend of ours, Jeanne Webber, aka “Butchie” if she was game to marry John? She agreed and the three of us went to City Hall and I was both witness and best man. A dramatic step, but it saved our group. Later John and Steve Boone wrote a song about her called “Butchies Tune”, that was on the Daydream album. She was one of a kind gal. 



John fell in love with a girl name Lorey and as we started to record our third album. Lorey dragged in a guy named Jack Lewis, who hyped John on getting involved with a movie project, writing songs for a Woody Allen movie, a stupid project called “What’s Up Tiger Lily?” John did a good job but it didn’t sound like the next Spoonful album. I had begged him not to do it but in vain. It was released as our third album. MGM sent out half a million records of which 350,000 came back. As I predicted, that lame release broke the momentum of our record sales. Instead of becoming a quick number one, when our real third album, HUMS came out a few months later, it struggled to reach number 14 on the charts. A terrible mistake. 



When we went to England, after London, the group played in a goofy little faux castle outside Dublin at the 21st birthday party of Tara Browne, heir to the Guinness fortune. There were huge quarter pound bars of hash in the carriage house behind the estate, brought by Brian Jones' friend, Martin. We smoked up a storm, and after the party wound down, John asked and was given a very large chunk of the hash. John and I went Irish Harp hunting the next day and then we had to catch a flight back to the states. John planned to bring the shit with him, which I recommended against highly. Standing in the customs line, an old gentleman in front of us had his dilapidated suitcases, held together with tape and string, opened by the customs officers. They were filled with homemade sausages. They looked and smelled great. A phalanx of officials headed in our direction. We were next in line. I turned to John, who was watching the proceedings and begged him to ditch the stuff. To my great relief, he walked across the room to the trash container, and the contraband hit the bottom with a large boom audible throughout the hall.



We kept recording and having hits. John was writing great material. But tensions were growing between John and Zally. The breakup of the group was coming. John and Bob fired Zal.  And shortly thereafter they fired me. 



After the Spoonful quit as a group, Kopplemen and Ruben and John’s stonewalling lawyer conspired to shut me out of being involved in any future prospective share of my production royalties. They succeeded. That was my thanks for having helped create those great records. Sleazeballs! I wasn’t even invited when Johnny was inducted into the songwriter's hall of fame. Recognition for all the songs we’d done together. He went with Kopplethief and Robberman. 



Later, John and I worked together on the Tarzana Kid album. Recording in San Francisco's Tenderloin, after dinner one night, I dragged John into a movie theatre to see a film I had heard about called "Animal Lover". Big Mistake! We couldn't stand to watch the whole thing, left and headed back to the studio. But the movie had been so disquieting, that neither of us was able to concentrate. John couldn't sing, and we called the session off. But we had a lot of fun. Fun doing the music, and fun hanging out again. And the album still sounds very good. We accomplished and shared so much together! 



We are and have been great pals since 64.
