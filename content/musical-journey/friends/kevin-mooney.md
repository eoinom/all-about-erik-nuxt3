Kevin was an intense little man that came by my office in the mid-70s. He was a songwriter and musician but had a lot of outside projects going on as well. In one of our first conversations, he offered me a little black box that would allow me to call anyone in the world and talk as long as I wanted. You only had to hold it next to a phone and put in certain codes to make it work, but it was too complicated for me. And this was in the early '70s. 



Kevin also sold dope. I went over to his pad one day, and he literally had duffle bags of weed down in his basement. A dozen different types. He was doing big business. 



He visited me at the Blue Goose and we went fishing together a few times. He called me “Sven.” He brought me a tape of two song demos I’ve included here. 



One day he came over with one hand all bandaged up, and related what had happened to him. He had come home to find a big tomcat had snuck into his apartment through his cat door and was eating his kitty’s food. The kitten was frightened and cowering in the corner. Kevin picked up a broom and went for the cat. It leaped at him and sunk its teeth deep into the back of his hand. He banged it on the counter and it let go, ran out the door, and down the three flights of steps to the front stoop. Looking out his balcony he saw the cat down there licking its paws. He picked up a big concrete cinder block, lined it up directly over the cat, and dropped it down the three stories to where the cat sat. A direct hit. It’s four legs were splayed out at the corners of the cement block. He put what was left of the cat’s body in a plastic bag and headed to the hospital with his hand bandaged and bleeding profusely. He wanted what was left of the cat's body checked for rabies. He waited in the emergency room but the lady in charge sat behind her desk and called in one patient after another, and she insisted he wait his turn. He was hurting and was getting angrier and more frustrated by the minute. He approached her desk with the plastic bag and demanded to see a doctor. She was blasé and unsympathetic. She asked what was in the bag, and he took out the cat’s mangled and bloody body with its entrails and organs hanging out, and smacked the thing down with a bloody thud on her desk. Unfazed, she calmly called someone to take the cat’s body away and clean her desk, and told him to sit down and wait his turn. 



He wanted to augment his marijuana sales income by selling cocaine. Several times he gave money to co-conspirators who went to Peru and scored some kilos, but in all cases except one they were stopped in Mexico on their way back. But he finally got five kilos through, and he was so happy. 



But within days I got a call from a mutual friend. Kevin was dead. The poor guy had been murdered by some coke dealers that had held him down, shoved a fatal dose up his ass, and stole his shit. The wonderful world of cocaine!
