I published three books on the subject, which can be found here on the site.\nI donated the entire collection to the Yale University Art Museum.",

These are the only traditional Indian textiles there of the modern era that contain large scale drawings of people and animals. They're somewhat akin to some of the work of their Pre-Columbian ancestor. The women weave skirts, called Aksus, as well as ponchos, belts, and bags. These weavers had the artistic licenses to pursue their individual design ideas. I donated this collection to the Denver Art Museum.",
